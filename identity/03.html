        <p>Here’s exactly how a strong .NET Tech Lead (or any senior engineer) handles discovering a hardcoded secret/password in a production codebase. This is the answer interviewers want to hear — it shows maturity, incident-response experience, and ownership.</p>

<th>Why &amp; How</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><strong>Don’t panic, but treat it as a live incident</strong></td>
<td>Assume the secret is already compromised (GitHub is scanned by bots in seconds).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><strong>Confirm it’s real and in use</strong></td>
<td>Check if the password/API key is actually used in any deployed environment (dev/staging/prod). Look at appsettings, Key Vault overrides, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><strong>Identify what the secret protects</strong></td>
<td>DB credential? Admin service account? Third-party API (Stripe, SendGrid, Twilio)? Azure service principal? The impact changes everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><strong>Check Git history immediately</strong></td>
<td><code>git log -p -S&quot;the-secret-value&quot;</code> or use GitHub’s secret scanning alerts. See when it was added and if it ever existed in a public repo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><strong>Rotate the secret RIGHT NOW</strong> (or revoke if it’s a key/token)</td>
<td>This is the #1 priority. Examples:<br>• DB password → new password + update all services<br>• API key → regenerate + notify provider if needed<br>• Service principal → new certificate/secret + update AAD app</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td><strong>Force-redeploy all affected services</strong></td>
<td>Even if you rotate, old containers/instances may still have the secret in memory or config cache.</td>
</tr>

<td>Move it to proper secret storage (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, User Secrets for local, etc.).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>If the repo is public or was ever public → assume breach. Check GitHub Secret Scanning alerts and “View secret scanning alerts” page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>Search the entire solution for other secrets: <br><code>grep -r &quot;password\|key\|secret\|pwd&quot; .</code> <br>Use tools: Gitleaks, TruffleHog, git-secret-scanner in CI.</td>

<h3 id="real-world-one-liner-you-can-say-in-the-interview">Real-World One-Liner You Can Say in the Interview</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I find a hardcoded secret, I treat it like a production outage: rotate immediately, force-redeploy everything that used it, remove it from history if possible (or accept it’s burned), then fix the process so it never happens again — because the second time is on me as the lead.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="bonus-if-the-secret-was-ever-in-a-public-repo">Bonus: If the secret was ever in a public repo</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>git filter-branch</code> or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove it from history (if private → easy; if public → too late, just rotate and monitor).</li>
<li>Contact the provider (e.g., GitHub will already have alerted you and possibly revoked the key automatically).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can confidently close with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In my last role we found a production DB password in code during a PR review. We rotated it in &lt;20 minutes, force-deployed, and added Gitleaks to every pipeline the same week. Zero downtime, zero breach.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next question — keep them coming! You’re going to nail this interview. 🚀</p>
