        <h3 id="difference-between-authentication-and-authorization">Difference Between Authentication and Authorization</h3>
<p>In security and access control systems (e.g., in web apps, APIs, or cloud services), <strong>authentication</strong> and <strong>authorization</strong> are two distinct but complementary processes. Authentication focuses on <em>identity verification</em>, while authorization deals with <em>permission granting</em>. They often work together: Authenticate first, then authorize based on the verified identity.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Aspect</th>
<th>Authentication</th>
<th>Authorization</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
<td>Verifies the identity of a user or system (e.g., &quot;Are you who you claim to be?&quot;).</td>
<td>Determines what actions or resources the authenticated user can access (e.g., &quot;What are you allowed to do?&quot;).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Purpose</strong></td>
<td>Prevents unauthorized access by confirming credentials.</td>
<td>Enforces policies to control access to specific features, data, or operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>When It Happens</strong></td>
<td>Typically first, during login or session start.</td>
<td>After authentication, ongoing for each request or action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Examples</strong></td>
<td>- Username/password login.<br>- Multi-factor authentication (MFA).<br>- JWT token validation.<br>- Biometrics (fingerprint).</td>
<td>- Role-based access (e.g., admin can delete users, user can only view).<br>- OAuth scopes (e.g., read vs. write permissions).<br>- File system ACLs (e.g., read-only access).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Failure Outcome</strong></td>
<td>Access denied; user is rejected (e.g., &quot;Invalid credentials&quot;).</td>
<td>Access partially or fully restricted (e.g., &quot;You can view but not edit&quot;).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Mechanisms</strong></td>
<td>Passwords, tokens, certificates, biometrics.</td>
<td>RBAC (Role-Based), ABAC (Attribute-Based), ACLs, policies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Analogy</strong></td>
<td>Showing ID at a club entrance to prove you're over 21.</td>
<td>Once inside, checking if your ticket allows VIP lounge access.</td>

<h4 id="how-they-interact">How They Interact</h4>
<ul>
<li>In a .NET web app (e.g., ASP.NET Core): Authentication might use Identity for login, generating a claims principal. Authorization then uses <code>[Authorize(Roles = &quot;Admin&quot;)]</code> attributes to gatekeep endpoints.</li>
<li>Common Pitfall: Skipping authorization after authentication can lead to breaches (e.g., authenticated but over-privileged users).</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, authentication answers <strong>&quot;Who are you?&quot;</strong>, while authorization answers <strong>&quot;What can you do?&quot;</strong>. Both are essential for robust security—implement them layered for defense-in-depth.</p>
