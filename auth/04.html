        <h3 id="access-control-models-overview-and-differences">Access Control Models: Overview and Differences</h3>
<p>Access control models define how permissions are granted to users, systems, or processes to access resources. They balance security, flexibility, and manageability. Below, I'll list four common models—<strong>RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)</strong>, <strong>ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)</strong>, <strong>ACL (Access Control Lists)</strong>, and <strong>ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control)</strong>—with brief descriptions. Then, a comparison table highlights their key differences.</p>
<h4 id="rbac-role-based-access-control">1. <strong>RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Permissions are assigned to <em>roles</em> (e.g., &quot;Admin&quot;, &quot;User&quot;), and users are assigned to roles. Access is granted based on the user's role. It's hierarchical (roles can inherit from others) and widely used in enterprise systems.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A &quot;Manager&quot; role allows viewing reports; users in that role inherit the permission.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="abac-attribute-based-access-control">2. <strong>ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Decisions use <em>attributes</em> (e.g., user location, time, resource sensitivity) evaluated against policies. A policy engine (e.g., XACML) dynamically computes access.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Allow access if user.department = &quot;HR&quot; AND time &gt; 9 AM AND resource.sensitivity = &quot;low&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="acl-access-control-lists">3. <strong>ACL (Access Control Lists)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Resources have explicit lists of users/groups and their permissions (e.g., read/write). It's resource-centric and simple for small-scale setups.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A file's ACL lists &quot;user1: read, write&quot; and &quot;group2: read-only&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rebac-relationship-based-access-control">4. <strong>ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Access is based on <em>relationships</em> between entities (e.g., user owns resource, or user is a follower of owner). Popular in graph-based systems like Google's Zanzibar.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Allow &quot;editor&quot; access if user is &quot;member_of&quot; the same &quot;team&quot; as the document owner.</li>
</ul>

<p>These models can be combined (e.g., RBAC + ABAC for hybrid control). Choose based on your system's scale, dynamics, and compliance needs—RBAC for simplicity, ABAC for nuance. If implementing in .NET, libraries like IdentityServer or Auth0 support these.</p>
