<p>Terraform, developed by HashiCorp, is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables declarative provisioning and management of infrastructure across multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments. It uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) for human-readable configs, emphasizing idempotency, modularity, and collaboration. Below is a table summarizing its core and advanced features, drawn from official documentation.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Declarative Configuration</strong></td>
<td>Define desired infrastructure state in code (HCL or JSON); Terraform computes and applies changes without manual intervention, ensuring reproducibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Multi-Provider Support</strong></td>
<td>Works with 100+ providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes) out-of-the-box, allowing hybrid/multi-cloud setups—ideal for .NET apps spanning Azure and AWS.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>State Management</strong></td>
<td>Tracks resource state in a backend file (local or remote like S3/Azure Blob) with versioning, locking, and encryption to prevent concurrent modifications and enable drift detection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Modularity via Modules</strong></td>
<td>Reusable code blocks for components (e.g., a VPC module); publish/share via private/public registries with testing workflows to enforce best practices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Stacks (GA in 2025)</strong></td>
<td>Coordinate and deploy interdependent configurations as a single unit, simplifying complex, multi-module setups like .NET microservices architectures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Drift Detection</strong></td>
<td>Continuously scans for unauthorized changes post-deploy, alerting and enabling resolution—crucial for compliance in regulated .NET environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Policy as Code</strong></td>
<td>Enforce security/compliance rules using Sentinel or OPA during runs (e.g., no public buckets), integrated into CI/CD pipelines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Collaboration &amp; VCS Integration</strong></td>
<td>Git-based workflows for PR reviews, approvals, and remote execution; supports role-based access (RBAC) for teams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Flexible Workflows</strong></td>
<td>Run via CLI, UI (Terraform Cloud/Enterprise), API, or CI/CD (e.g., Azure DevOps); includes concurrent runs and ephemeral workspaces for cost optimization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Audit &amp; Monitoring</strong></td>
<td>Detailed logs, event notifications (Slack/Email), and integrations (Splunk) for visibility; continuous validation with custom assertions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Migration Tools</strong></td>
<td>Config-driven import for onboarding existing resources; automated upgrades from open-source to enterprise editions.</td>
</tr>

<p>These features make Terraform scalable for everything from small .NET prototypes to enterprise-grade deployments, reducing ops overhead by ~70% in mature setups.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip for Your Interview</strong>: Highlight Stacks for 2025 relevance—&quot;I'd use Terraform Stacks to orchestrate a .NET API's Azure infra (App Service + Cosmos DB) in one apply, with OPA policies to gate deploys.&quot; Next question?</p>
