        <h3 id="when-to-consider-using-asymmetric-encryption">When to Consider Using Asymmetric Encryption</h3>
<p>Asymmetric encryption (also called public-key encryption) is the go-to choice when <strong>secure key distribution</strong> is a primary concern, or when you need features like authentication and non-repudiation that symmetric encryption lacks. It's particularly valuable in open or untrusted environments where sharing a secret key isn't feasible. However, due to its computational intensity, it's often hybridized with symmetric encryption (e.g., for key exchange only).</p>
<h4 id="key-decision-factors">Key Decision Factors</h4>
<p>Opt for asymmetric encryption if:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Sharing is Insecure or Impractical</strong>: No trusted channel exists to exchange symmetric keys (e.g., over public internet).</li>
<li><strong>Authentication or Signatures are Needed</strong>: You want to prove identity or integrity without revealing secrets (e.g., digital signatures).</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Party or Broadcast Scenarios</strong>: Scaling to many recipients without pairwise secret sharing.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory/Compliance Requirements</strong>: Standards like FIPS mandate it for certain uses (e.g., certificates).</li>
<li><strong>One-Time Setup Tolerance</strong>: Initial overhead is acceptable for long-term security (e.g., in protocols like TLS).</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid it if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance is paramount for large data (use symmetric for payloads).</li>
<li>Key management overhead (e.g., certificate revocation) is too complex for your setup.</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td><strong>Key Distribution</strong></td>

<td>Closed systems with pre-shared keys.</td>

<h4 id="typical-use-cases">Typical Use Cases</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure Key Exchange</strong>: In TLS/HTTPS handshakes—use RSA/ECC to encrypt a symmetric session key, then switch to AES for the session.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Signatures and Certificates</strong>: Signing code or emails (e.g., PGP); verifying SSL certs for website authenticity.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Email and Messaging</strong>: Encrypting to public keys in tools like GPG or Signal (for initial setup).</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain and Crypto</strong>: Signing transactions (e.g., ECDSA in Ethereum) or deriving addresses from public keys.</li>
<li><strong>VPN/SSH Authentication</strong>: Public-key auth for logins without passwords.</li>
<li><strong>Software Distribution</strong>: Signing updates to prevent tampering (e.g., Microsoft's code signing).</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, choose asymmetric for <strong>trust in untrusted channels</strong>—it's the enabler of modern secure comms. For efficiency, always hybridize: Asymmetric for setup, symmetric for the heavy lifting. If quantum threats loom, migrate to post-quantum algorithms like Kyber.</p>
