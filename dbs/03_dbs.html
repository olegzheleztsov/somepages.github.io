        <h3 id="types-of-non-relational-nosql-databases-and-their-use-cases">Types of Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases and Their Use Cases</h3>
<p>Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are categorized into four primary types based on their data models and query mechanisms. Each type is designed to handle specific data structures and workloads efficiently, often prioritizing scalability and flexibility over strict ACID compliance. Below is a table summarizing the types, key characteristics, and common use cases:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Key Characteristics</th>
<th>Common Use Cases</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Key-Value Stores</strong></td>
<td>Simplest form; data stored as unique keys mapped to values (opaque objects like strings or blobs). Fast lookups by key; no complex querying.</td>
<td>- <strong>Caching</strong>: Storing temporary data for quick access (e.g., Redis for web session caching).<br>- <strong>Real-time analytics</strong>: Leaderboards in gaming or shopping carts.<br>- <strong>Configuration storage</strong>: Simple key-based settings in distributed systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Document Stores</strong></td>
<td>Store data as semi-structured documents (e.g., JSON or BSON); flexible schemas allow nested fields. Supports querying within documents.</td>
<td>- <strong>Content management</strong>: Blogs or CMS where articles have varying attributes (e.g., MongoDB for user profiles with dynamic fields).<br>- <strong>E-commerce catalogs</strong>: Product listings with diverse attributes like images and specs.<br>- <strong>Mobile apps</strong>: Handling user-generated content with evolving schemas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Column-Family Stores</strong> (Wide-Column Stores)</td>
<td>Data organized in columns rather than rows; supports massive scalability for sparse data. Good for aggregations across columns.</td>
<td>- <strong>Time-series data</strong>: IoT sensor logs or stock tickers (e.g., Cassandra for high-write-volume event tracking).<br>- <strong>Big data analytics</strong>: Logging and monitoring in large-scale systems.<br>- <strong>Messaging queues</strong>: Distributed logs for applications like recommendation engines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Graph Databases</strong></td>
<td>Model data as nodes, edges, and properties; optimized for traversing relationships. Uses graph theory for queries.</td>
<td>- <strong>Social networks</strong>: Friend connections and recommendations (e.g., Neo4j for Facebook-like graphs).<br>- <strong>Fraud detection</strong>: Analyzing transaction networks for anomalies.<br>- <strong>Knowledge graphs</strong>: Semantic search in recommendation systems or supply chain mapping.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These types can overlap in hybrid use cases, and many modern NoSQL databases support multiple models. Selection depends on factors like data volume, query patterns, and consistency needs.</p>
