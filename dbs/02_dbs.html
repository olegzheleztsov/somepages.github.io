<p>Relational databases (RDBMS) excel in scenarios requiring strict data consistency, complex relationships, and standardized querying, while non-relational databases (NoSQL) shine in handling unstructured or semi-structured data at massive scale with high flexibility and performance. The choice depends on factors like data structure, query complexity, scalability needs, and consistency requirements.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Relational (SQL)</strong></td>
<td>- Fixed schemas with tables, rows, and relationships (joins).<br>- ACID compliance for transactions.<br>- Strong data integrity via constraints.</td>
<td>- <strong>Transactional systems</strong>: Banking (e.g., account balances, transfers), e-commerce (order processing, inventory management).<br>- <strong>Financial reporting</strong>: ERP systems for audits and compliance.<br>- <strong>Applications with complex queries</strong>: CRM tools involving multi-table joins (e.g., customer orders linked to products and shipping).</td>
<td>MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Non-Relational (NoSQL)</strong></td>
<td>- Schema-less or flexible schemas.<br>- BASE model (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) for scalability.<br>- Horizontal scaling across distributed nodes.</td>
<td>- <strong>High-volume, unstructured data</strong>: Social media feeds (e.g., user posts with varying media types in MongoDB).<br>- <strong>Real-time applications</strong>: Caching sessions or leaderboards in gaming (e.g., Redis for key-value storage).<br>- <strong>Big data analytics</strong>: IoT sensor data streams (e.g., Cassandra for time-series logs).<br>- <strong>Graph-heavy scenarios</strong>: Recommendation engines or fraud detection (e.g., Neo4j for network analysis like social connections).</td>
<td>MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (column-family), Neo4j (graph)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In summary, use relational DBs for structured, relationship-driven operations where data accuracy is paramount, and non-relational for agile, high-throughput environments like web-scale apps. Many modern systems (e.g., microservices) combine both via polyglot persistence for optimal performance.</p>
